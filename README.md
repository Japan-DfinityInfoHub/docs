# Write code for the Internet Computer

You can get started right away by downloading the Internet Computer Software Development Kit (SDK) and cloning an existing sample project or by exploring the documentation. Check out the links below to begin building smart contract canisters to run on the Internet Computer:

- [_Get the SDK_](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/download.html) Download the SDK for the Internet Computer.
- [_Quick Start_](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html) Deploy your first app on the Internet Computer.
- [_Examples Repository_](https://github.com/dfinity/examples) Explore on your own in the examples repository.
- [_Language Guide_](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html) Explore the Motoko programming language.
- [_Videos_](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/videos-tutorials.html) Watch the _Building Applications for the Internet Computer: Fundamentals_ video series.

# Contributing to the documentation

The [Internet Computer blockchain](https://dfinity.org/developers) is removing the limitations from smart contract software with a network that scales its capacity with demand and serves interactive web content directly to end users.
If you are interested in learning more about the project, you can connect with other developers in the community through the [Developer Forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/) and follow us on social media for information about upcoming events and new developments.

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, see our [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE OF CONDUCT](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started.
